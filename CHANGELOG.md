# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenFaceFX are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): while on `0.x`, minor versions may
contain breaking changes; the JSON track format is versioned independently via
its `version` field.

## [Unreleased]

Planned work is tracked in the
[issue backlog](https://github.com/OpenFaceFX/OpenFaceFX/issues) and the README
roadmap: Bethesda `.LIP` exporter, Unity/OVRLipSync exporter, published remap
tables, Gentle & Whisper adapters, expression layering.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-10

Initial public release.

### Added
- Full lip-sync pipeline: audio + transcript → time-stamped phonemes →
  Oculus/Meta 15-viseme targets → Cohen–Massaro dominance coarticulation →
  Ramer–Douglas–Peucker keyframe reduction → `FaceTrack`.
- Two alignment paths: Montreal Forced Aligner TextGrid parser
  (`load_mfa_textgrid`) and a dependency-free naive aligner with per-phoneme
  duration priors.
- G2P with seed CMU dictionary and rule fallback; `load_cmudict()` for the
  full dictionary.
- CLI: `openfacefx naive` (text + WAV/duration) and `openfacefx mfa`
  (TextGrid), JSON and CSV output.
- Self-contained HTML previewer (`tools/build_preview.py`): schematic
  articulator, per-channel curve plots, scrubbing playhead.
- Versioned JSON interchange format (`openfacefx.track`, version 1).
- Test suite plus CI across Linux/Windows/macOS on Python 3.9/3.12/3.13.
- FaceFX-ecosystem compatibility survey (`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`).

### Fixed
- Windows: `tools/build_preview.py` now reads the template and track JSON as
  UTF-8 instead of the locale default (cp1252), which failed with
  `UnicodeDecodeError`.
